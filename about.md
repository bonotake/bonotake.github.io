I'm a software engineer and a researcher at [Idein Inc.](https://idein.jp/),
 where I'm currently tackling with verification of deep learning models and deep learning compilers (or "graph compilers").  
For the research, I'm jointly working with [Ichiro Hasuo](https://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/), [Fuyuki Ishikawa](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~f-ishikawa/en/), and other members in [Erato MMSD project](http://www.jst.go.jp/erato/hasuo/en/index.html).

I received my Master's degree from [Akinori Yonezawa](http://www.yl.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yonezawa/home.html) at University of Tokyo. Then, I had experienced several years of studying eagerly with [Masami Hagiya](http://nicosia.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/hagiya.html). Once I was a visiting scientist at MIT, where [Daniel Jackson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/) and [Michael Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/) co-hosted me.

### Interests

#### Excerpt (All in Japanese)
- An Improvement of Quasi-weakest Precondition Inference using Fast MCS Enumeration
  - IMAI Takeo, SAKAI Masahiro, HAGIYA Masami
  - Computer Software   32(4) 4_161-4_175   2015
  - Abstract: We previously proposed a method to infer preconditions that are the weakest in a combination of predicates (quasi-weakest preconditions). This method, however, had a problem in performance due to the high cost of minimal-unsatisfiable-core (or MUC...
- Interplay between SAT and Other Constraint Problems
  - SAKAI Masahiro, IMAI Takeo
  - Computer Software   32(1) 1_103-1_119   2015
  - Abstract: Boolean SATisfiability problem (hereafter SAT) is the problem of deciding whether there exists an assignment to variables in a given propositional formula that makes the formula true. SAT is a computationally difficult problem as it is a classical...
- An Inference Method of Quasi-Weakest Preconditions by Minimal Unsatisfiable Core Enumeration
  - IMAI Takeo, SAKAI Masahiro, HAGIYA Masami
  - Computer Software   30(2) 2_207-2_226   2013
