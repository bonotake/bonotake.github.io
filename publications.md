- An Improvement of Quasi-weakest Precondition Inference using Fast MCS Enumeration
  - IMAI Takeo, SAKAI Masahiro, HAGIYA Masami
  - Computer Software   32(4) 4_161-4_175   2015
  - Abstract: We previously proposed a method to infer preconditions that are the weakest in a combination of predicates (quasi-weakest preconditions). This method, however, had a problem in performance due to the high cost of minimal-unsatisfiable-core (or MUC...
- Interplay between SAT and Other Constraint Problems
  - SAKAI Masahiro, IMAI Takeo
  - Computer Software   32(1) 1_103-1_119   2015
  - Abstract: Boolean SATisfiability problem (hereafter SAT) is the problem of deciding whether there exists an assignment to variables in a given propositional formula that makes the formula true. SAT is a computationally difficult problem as it is a classical...
- An Inference Method of Quasi-Weakest Preconditions by Minimal Unsatisfiable Core Enumeration
  - IMAI Takeo, SAKAI Masahiro, HAGIYA Masami
  - Computer Software   30(2) 2_207-2_226   2013
